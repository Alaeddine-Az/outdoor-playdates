🌱 GoPlayNow – Outdoor Playdate Companion App

GoPlayNow is a web application that helps parents discover and schedule meaningful outdoor playdates for their children. It aims to build a thriving community of families who value real-world connection, unstructured play, and childhood exploration beyond screens.

🚀 Motivation

Today’s children face a growing lack of outdoor, social, and creative experiences. Too often, screen time replaces face time. As parents ourselves, we wanted a tool that makes it easy to:
	•	Spark spontaneous outdoor adventures.
	•	Connect with like-minded families.
	•	Help kids develop confidence, friendships, and a love of nature.

GoPlayNow was born from this need—a simple yet powerful platform that transforms free time into quality time.
